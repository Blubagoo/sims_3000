# DESIGN PRINCIPLES
# ============================================================================

design_principles:
  visual_identity:
    habitation: |
      Organic, rounded forms. Asymmetric, natural silhouettes. Evokes living
      growth — dwellings appear grown, not built. Soft curves, cellular patterns,
      bioluminescent veining. Inviting, warm presence.

    exchange: |
      Outward-facing, displaying. Asymmetric with emphasis on exterior surfaces
      (windows, panels, signage). Structures "unfurl" to show their wares.
      Bright accent panels, energetic character. Welcoming to customers.

    fabrication: |
      Angular, geometric, industrial. Hard edges, 90-degree angles, modular
      blocks. Metallic or matte surfaces. Vents, exhausts, visible machinery.
      Powerful, utilitarian aesthetic.

  density_distinction:
    low_density: |
      Smaller footprint (1x1 sectors), lower height, simpler forms.
      Single focal point, fewer details. Quicker to materialize (2-4 seconds).
      Visual impression: individual units, spread out.

    high_density: |
      Larger footprint (1x1 or 2x2 sectors), taller structures, complex forms.
      Multiple focal points, layered details. Slower to materialize (5-10 seconds).
      Visual impression: concentrated growth, vertical expansion.

  sector_value_tiers:
    poor: |
      Basic structures — functional, minimal ornamentation. Lower glow intensity,
      simpler geometry. Desirability 0-85. These materialize in low-value sectors.

    moderate: |
      Standard structures — balanced design, moderate detail. Medium glow
      intensity, moderate complexity. Desirability 85-170. The default tier.

    wealthy: |
      Premium structures — elaborate design, high detail. Bright glow intensity,
      complex geometry. Desirability 170-255. High-value sectors only.

  alien_terminology:
    description: |
      All template names use canonical alien terms from terminology.yaml.
      NO human terms (house, apartment, shop, factory).

# ART PIPELINE NOTES
# ============================================================================

art_pipeline:
  3d_model_creation:
    description: |
      These briefs guide creation of glTF 2.0 (.glb) 3D models for each template.
      Models should be optimized for real-time rendering (low-poly, baked lighting).

    polygon_budget:
      low_density: "200-500 triangles per structure"
      high_density: "500-1200 triangles per structure"

    texture_resolution:
      low_density: "512x512 or 1024x1024"
      high_density: "1024x1024 or 2048x2048"

    emissive_mapping:
      description: |
        Emissive texture maps define glow regions. Shader reads emissive map
        and applies zone color (cyan/amber/magenta) at runtime.

  procedural_fallback:
    description: |
      Until 3D models are created, procedural geometry generates placeholder
      structures based on these briefs. Simple geometric primitives (cylinders,
      boxes, spheres) with approximate silhouettes.

    priority: "Low density templates first (simpler geometry)"

  additional_templates:
    description: |
      30 templates is the minimum. Future content updates can add more templates
      for greater visual variety. Target 50-100 templates long-term.

  special_buildings:
    description: |
      Epic 14 (Progression) adds unique reward buildings (monuments, arcologies).
      These are distinct from zone templates and have custom designs.

      Optional: Seasonal or event-themed variants (holiday decorations, special
      lighting). Deferred to post-launch content.
