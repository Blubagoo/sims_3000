# Epic 14: Progression & Rewards - Game Designer Analysis

**Author:** Game Designer Agent
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Canon Version:** 0.14.0
**Status:** Initial Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Progression in ZergCity must celebrate player achievement without creating endings or gates. Core Principle 4 (Endless Sandbox) means milestones are **celebrations**, not victory conditions. The "Exodus" feature from SimCity 2000 is fundamentally incompatible with our sandbox philosophy and is replaced by the **Transcendence Monument** - a permanent marker of achievement that celebrates a colony's greatness without ending play.

This epic creates the "achievement feeling" loop: **grow -> milestone -> celebrate -> reward -> express -> grow more**. Each milestone should feel like a personal triumph that other overseers witness and appreciate.

---

## 1. Milestone Experience Design

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

**"Milestones celebrate what you've built, not what you've won."**

In an endless sandbox, milestones serve a fundamentally different purpose than in competitive games:

| Traditional Game | ZergCity Sandbox |
|------------------|------------------|
| Milestones gate content | Milestones unlock rewards |
| Missing milestones = failure | No milestones required to play |
| Win condition focus | Expression focus |
| Competition between players | Parallel journeys, shared celebration |

### 1.2 Emotional Journey Per Milestone

| Threshold | Name | Core Emotion | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2K beings | First Achievement | **Pride** | "I actually did it - my colony works!" |
| 10K beings | Establishment | **Confidence** | "I know what I'm doing now" |
| 30K beings | Expression | **Identity** | "This colony is uniquely mine" |
| 60K beings | Security | **Power** | "My colony is strong and protected" |
| 90K beings | Spectacle | **Awe** | "Look at what I've created" |
| 120K beings | Aspiration | **Ambition** | "What else is possible?" |

### 1.3 Milestone Celebration Design

Each milestone should have a **multi-sensory celebration moment**:

#### 2,000 Beings - "Colony Emergence"

**Celebration Experience:**
- **Audio:** Soft chime sequence building to triumphant tone
- **Visual:** Brief golden glow pulses across colony, bioluminescent flora brightens
- **UI Notification:** "Your colony has emerged! 2,000 beings now call this place home."
- **Unlock Alert:** "The Overseer's Sanctum is now available to construct."
- **Duration:** 3-5 seconds of celebration, non-intrusive

**Emotional Goal:** "This feels like a real accomplishment, but I want to keep growing."

#### 10,000 Beings - "Colony Establishment"

**Celebration Experience:**
- **Audio:** Resonant achievement tone with echo (bigger than 2K)
- **Visual:** Wave of light ripples outward from colony center, structures pulse in sequence
- **UI Notification:** "Establishment achieved! 10,000 beings thrive under your guidance."
- **Unlock Alert:** "The Command Nexus and Edict system are now available."
- **Special:** Other players receive notification: "Overseer [Name] has established their colony!"
- **Duration:** 5-7 seconds

**Emotional Goal:** "I've arrived. Other players know I'm here. Now I can really start shaping this colony."

#### 30,000 Beings - "Colony Identity"

**Celebration Experience:**
- **Audio:** Layered harmonic tones, celebratory but not overwhelming
- **Visual:** Colony-wide aurora effect, unique color based on player faction
- **UI Notification:** "Your colony stands proud among 30,000 beings!"
- **Unlock Alert:** "Monument construction is now available."
- **Special:** Monument placement becomes a "choose your legacy" moment
- **Duration:** 6-8 seconds

**Emotional Goal:** "This is who I am as an overseer. This monument will represent me."

#### 60,000 Beings - "Colony Security"

**Celebration Experience:**
- **Audio:** Powerful, bass-heavy achievement sound - feels substantial
- **Visual:** Shield-like energy wave emanates from colony center
- **UI Notification:** "60,000 beings look to you for protection and prosperity."
- **Unlock Alert:** "Defense Installation construction is now available."
- **World Event:** Permanent subtle visual change (terrain glow intensifies?)
- **Duration:** 7-9 seconds

**Emotional Goal:** "My colony is strong. I can protect what I've built."

#### 90,000 Beings - "Colony Wonder"

**Celebration Experience:**
- **Audio:** Grand orchestral-style achievement (the biggest celebration sound)
- **Visual:** Spectacular light show - multiple layers, particle effects, sky effects
- **UI Notification:** "90,000 beings marvel at what you've created!"
- **Unlock Alert:** "The Resonance Spire is now available - a beacon for all to see."
- **Server Broadcast:** All players see a visual beacon appear at this colony
- **Duration:** 8-10 seconds

**Emotional Goal:** "This is a spectacle. Everyone on the map knows something special just happened."

#### 120,000 Beings - "Colony Ascension"

**Celebration Experience:**
- **Audio:** Ethereal, transcendent tones - otherworldly quality
- **Visual:** Reality itself seems to shimmer, chromatic effects
- **UI Notification:** "Your colony approaches transcendence. 120,000 beings share your vision."
- **Unlock Alert:** "Arcology construction is now available. Build toward the stars."
- **Philosophical Moment:** Brief reflection UI - "What will your legacy be?"
- **Duration:** 10-12 seconds

**Emotional Goal:** "This is end-game content. I'm among the elite. What comes next?"

### 1.4 Multiplayer Milestone Dynamics

#### What Other Players See

| Your Milestone | Their Experience |
|----------------|------------------|
| 2K | Subtle glow visible in distance, no notification |
| 10K | Toast notification: "Overseer [X] established their colony" |
| 30K | Toast + visual marker on their minimap |
| 60K | Toast + brief visual effect visible from their perspective |
| 90K | Server-wide beacon visible from anywhere on map |
| 120K | Server-wide celebration effect (brief aurora across entire map) |

#### Social Dynamics

**Friendly Competition:**
- "Who hits 10K first?" becomes natural water-cooler talk
- Milestones create benchmarks without being victory conditions
- Seeing rivals succeed motivates growth

**Shared Celebration:**
- Hitting a milestone while friends are playing = social moment
- Chat activity naturally increases around milestone events
- Creates stories: "Remember when you hit 60K during that catastrophe?"

**No Pressure:**
- Players who grow slowly still get full celebrations when they arrive
- No punishment for being "behind"
- Each player's journey is their own

## 2. Reward Building Experience Design

### 2.1 Design Principles for Reward Buildings

1. **Prestige First:** Reward buildings should look impressive above all else
2. **Utility Second:** Functional benefits are nice-to-have, not the point
3. **Placement Freedom:** Players choose where to place for maximum visual impact
4. **Alien Authenticity:** Each building must feel like it belongs in this world
5. **Bioluminescent Showpiece:** These are the most glowing, most impressive structures

### 2.2 Reward Building Details

---

#### 2,000 Beings: The Overseer's Sanctum

**Alien Theme:**
The personal dwelling of the colony's overseer - a structure of status and authority. Unlike standard habitation, this is where the guiding consciousness resides. Think of it as a nerve center for overseer presence.

**Visual Design:**

- **Secondary:** Small sector_value boost to adjacent tiles (+10)
- **Visual:** Unique building that signals "the overseer lives here"

**Placement Psychology:**
- Most players place near colony center (prestige location)
- Some place at highest elevation (overlooking colony)
- Some place at colony entrance (first thing visitors see)

**Experience Goal:** "This is MY place. It represents me in this world."

---

#### 10,000 Beings: The Command Nexus

**Alien Theme:**
The administrative hub of a mature colony - where edicts are issued, colony-wide data is processed, and major decisions are made. This is the brain of the colony.

**Visual Design:**
- **Form:** Horizontal sprawl with central spire, communication arrays
- **Scale:** 3x3 tiles, substantial footprint, medium height
- **Materials:** Metallic bio-organic hybrid, antenna-like projections
- **Bioluminescence:** Active data streams visible as flowing light patterns

- Placement matters for service radius benefit

**Experience Goal:** "Now I can truly shape this colony's character through policy."

---

#### 30,000 Beings: The Eternity Marker (Monument)

**Alien Theme:**
A monument to the colony's existence - not to a person, but to the collective achievement of reaching 30K beings. This is the colony saying "we are here, and we matter."

**Visual Design:**
- **Form:** Abstract sculptural form, each placement is unique (procedural variation)
- **Scale:** 2x2 tiles, tall and dramatic (8-10 stories equivalent)
- **Materials:** Prismatic crystal construction, refracts light
- **Bioluminescence:** Rainbow-spectrum light play, shifts with time of day

- **Secondary:** Major sector_value boost (+25 to adjacent tiles)
- **Visual:** Landmark visible across the map, identifies colony character

**Placement Psychology:**
- Highly personal choice - represents player identity
- Some place in parks/green_zones (contemplative)
- Some place in exchange districts (economic showcase)
- Some place at colony entrance (statement)

**Experience Goal:** "This monument is me. It tells everyone who I am as an overseer."

---

#### 60,000 Beings: The Aegis Complex (Defense Installation)

**Alien Theme:**
A military installation that provides both active defense and psychological security. The colony is now powerful enough to project force and protect its interests.

**Visual Design:**
- **Form:** Angular, imposing, geometric precision (contrast to organic colony)
- **Scale:** 4x4 tiles, sprawling military complex, moderate height
- **Materials:** Armored biometal, reinforced structures
- **Bioluminescence:** Sharp amber/orange warning lights, scanner sweeps
- **Signature Element:** Energy shield projector (visible dome during alerts)
- **Activity:** Patrol vehicles/beings visible moving around perimeter

**Four Variants (player chooses one):**

| Variant | Visual Focus | Special Benefit |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Aerial Aegis** | Launch pads, aircraft | +25% catastrophe warning time |
| **Ground Aegis** | Armored vehicles, walls | +20% structure durability |
| **Orbital Aegis** | Satellite dishes, receivers | +30% cosmic catastrophe resistance |
| **Naval Aegis** | Docks, watercraft (if near water) | +25% inundation resistance |

**Functional Benefits:**
- **Primary:** Catastrophe damage reduction in 20-tile radius (-15%)
- **Secondary:** Response time bonus for hazard_response and enforcers
- **Tertiary:** Massive sector_value boost to adjacent tiles (+35)
- **Visual:** Visible security presence makes colony feel "safe"

**Placement Psychology:**
- Strategic players place at vulnerable colony edge
- Prestige players place centrally (show of power)
- Water colonies prefer Naval variant near coast

**Experience Goal:** "My colony is protected. Catastrophes will not destroy what I've built."

---

#### 90,000 Beings: The Resonance Spire (Special Landmark)

**Alien Theme:**
A wonder of alien engineering - a structure that exists as much for its beauty and awe as for any practical purpose. This is the colony's great work, their statement to the universe.

**Visual Design:**
- **Form:** Impossibly tall spiraling structure, defies normal physics
- **Scale:** 3x3 tiles, MASSIVE height (tallest structure possible, 30+ stories)
- **Materials:** Living crystal that grows and shifts subtly
- **Bioluminescence:** Intense, color-shifting, visible from anywhere on map
- **Signature Element:** Resonance pulse every 30 seconds (visible/audible)
- **Weather Effect:** Causes subtle aurora in sky above colony

**Functional Benefits:**
- **Primary:** +20% harmony colony-wide (beings feel inspired)
- **Secondary:** Tourism magnet (+30% exchange demand in 25-tile radius)
- **Tertiary:** Prestige - other players can see this from their colony
- **Quaternary:** Slight contamination reduction (crystal purifies)

**Placement Psychology:**
- Central placement for maximum visual impact
- Hilltop placement for visibility
- This is THE statement piece - placement is deeply personal

**Experience Goal:** "This is my magnum opus. Everyone on this map knows I built something incredible."

---

#### 120,000 Beings: Arcology Unlock

**Note:** Arcologies are not a single reward building but an unlock for an entire building category. See Section 3 for detailed arcology design.

**Unlock Experience:**
- Reaching 120K doesn't give a specific building - it unlocks arcology CONSTRUCTION
- Player must then choose which arcology type to build (significant investment)
- Multiple arcologies can be built over time

---

### 2.3 Reward Building Visual Hierarchy

```

---

## 3. Arcology Design

### 3.1 Arcology Philosophy

**"Cities within cities - the ultimate expression of colony ambition."**

Arcologies in ZergCity represent the pinnacle of building achievement. They are:
- **Massive:** 4x4 tile footprint, enormous vertical presence
- **Self-Contained:** High-density living that reduces infrastructure strain
- **End-Game:** Require 120K beings just to unlock, then significant investment
- **Aspirational:** Something to work toward for dozens of hours

### 3.2 No Year-Based Unlocks

**Critical Decision:** Unlike SimCity 2000, we do NOT gate arcologies by game year.

**Rationale:**
1. Core Principle 4 (Endless Sandbox) - no artificial time gates
2. Players shouldn't have to wait passively for content
3. Population thresholds reward active achievement
4. Different players play at different speeds

**All arcology types unlock at 120K beings simultaneously.**

### 3.3 Arcology Types

| Arcology | Capacity | Cost | Visual Theme | Special Feature |
|----------|----------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Genesis Arcology** | 2,000 beings | 50,000 cr | Organic, grown structures | +5% birth rate colony-wide |
| **Nexus Arcology** | 15,000 beings | 80,000 cr | Technological, angular | +10% exchange productivity |
| **Harmony Arcology** | 45,000 beings | 150,000 cr | Balanced, flowing | +15% harmony, no contamination |
| **Ascension Arcology** | 65,000 beings | 250,000 cr | Transcendent, ethereal | Required for Transcendence Monument |

### 3.4 Arcology Visual Design

#### Genesis Arcology (2,000 capacity)

**Theme:** The smallest arcology - a living biological structure grown from the planet itself.

**Visual:**
- **Form:** Organic dome with branching structures, like a giant seed pod
- **Scale:** 4x4 tiles, moderate height (10-12 stories)
- **Materials:** Living biomatter, organic shell
- **Bioluminescence:** Soft green/teal glow, pulsing like heartbeat
- **Activity:** Visible flora growth on exterior, breathing animations
- **Personality:** Feels alive, nurturing, natural

#### Nexus Arcology (15,000 capacity)

**Theme:** A technological marvel - efficient, geometric, maximizing space through engineering.

**Visual:**
- **Form:** Stepped pyramid with data spires, industrial elegance
- **Scale:** 4x4 tiles, tall (15-18 stories)
- **Materials:** Metallic alloys, crystalline panels
- **Bioluminescence:** Amber/orange data streams, processing lights
- **Activity:** Transport pods visible moving, energy flows
- **Personality:** Efficient, productive, modern

#### Harmony Arcology (45,000 capacity)

**Theme:** The balance between nature and technology - sustainable ultra-density.

**Visual:**
- **Form:** Flowing curves, integrated green spaces, vertical gardens
- **Scale:** 4x4 tiles, very tall (20-25 stories)
- **Materials:** Bio-tech hybrid, living walls
- **Bioluminescence:** Multi-spectrum, shifts with time of day
- **Activity:** Water features, vegetation movement, serene energy
- **Personality:** Peaceful, balanced, aspirational

#### Ascension Arcology (65,000 capacity)

**Theme:** Transcendent architecture - a structure that seems to exist partially outside normal space.

**Visual:**
- **Form:** Impossible geometry, floating elements, reality-bending design
- **Scale:** 4x4 tiles, tallest arcology (25-30 stories)
- **Materials:** Phase-shifted materials, partially transparent
- **Bioluminescence:** Intense white/violet, otherworldly
- **Activity:** Elements appear to float, shimmer, phase in and out
- **Personality:** Transcendent, awe-inspiring, end-game

### 3.5 Arcology Gameplay Impact

**Why Build Arcologies?**

1. **Massive Population Density:** A single 4x4 arcology can house more beings than dozens of standard habitation zones
2. **Infrastructure Efficiency:** Arcologies are self-contained (reduced power/water strain per capita)
3. **Prestige:** These are the most impressive structures you can build
4. **Milestone Progress:** Arcologies count toward Transcendence Monument threshold

**Arcology Economics:**

| Arcology | Build Cost | Maintenance/Cycle | Tribute Generated |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Genesis | 50,000 cr | 200 cr | 800 cr |
| Nexus | 80,000 cr | 400 cr | 1,500 cr |
| Harmony | 150,000 cr | 600 cr | 3,000 cr |
| Ascension | 250,000 cr | 1,000 cr | 5,500 cr |

**Balance Note:** Arcologies should be economically viable but not strictly superior to regular development. They represent a different playstyle (vertical density) not an optimal strategy.

### 3.6 Arcology Placement

**Requirements:**
- Must be built on owned tiles (4x4 contiguous)
- Requires energy and fluid coverage
- Requires pathway adjacency
- Cannot be built on special terrain (water, blight_mires)

**Visual Considerations:**
- Players will want arcologies visible from multiple angles
- Placement affects overall colony skyline
- Clustering arcologies creates "mega-city" effect

---

## 4. Transcendence Monument Design

### 4.1 Replacing the Exodus

**SimCity 2000's "Exodus":**
- 300+ launch arcologies trigger mass departure
- Arcologies "launch" to colonize new worlds
- Population drastically reduced
- Essentially a "soft win condition"

**Why This Doesn't Fit ZergCity:**
1. Core Principle 4: No win/lose states
2. Exodus ends play - opposite of endless sandbox
3. Population reduction punishes achievement
4. "Launching away" abandons what you built

**The Transcendence Monument Solution:**

Instead of beings leaving, the colony **transcends** - reaching a state of such achievement that it earns a permanent marker of greatness. The beings don't leave; they've achieved something worth commemorating.

### 4.2 Transcendence Monument Concept

**Theme:** "We have reached beyond. This moment is eternal."

The Transcendence Monument is:
- A celebration, not an ending
- Built by the player, not automatic
- Permanent and visible to all
- Repeatable (build multiple over time)

**Unlock Requirements:**
- 300+ Ascension Arcologies constructed
- OR equivalent capacity across any arcology mix (300 * 65,000 = 19,500,000 beings in arcologies)
- Simplified: **Total arcology capacity >= 500,000 beings**

**Practical Threshold (More Achievable):**
- Given Ascension's 65K capacity: 8 Ascension Arcologies = 520K capacity
- Mixed: 5 Ascension (325K) + 4 Harmony (180K) = 505K capacity

### 4.3 Transcendence Monument Visual Design

**Form:** A structure that exists partially outside normal space - a permanent tear in reality where pure light emanates.

**Visual Elements:**
- **Base:** 4x4 tile crystalline platform, embedded in terrain
- **Core:** Pillar of light extending infinitely upward
- **Effect:** Reality distortion around base (shimmer, chromatic aberration)
- **Aura:** Beings near monument move differently (slight slow-motion effect)
- **Sky Effect:** Permanent aurora in sky above monument
- **Night Mode:** Brightest object in the world, visible from everywhere

**Audio:**
- Constant subtle harmonic tone
- Ethereal whispers at close range
- Reality-bending sound effects

**Scale:** The largest single structure in the game, visible from any point on the map.

### 4.4 Transcendence Monument Functional Effects

**Primary:** Prestige and permanent achievement marker

**Secondary Benefits:**
- +25% harmony in 50-tile radius (beings feel transcendence)
- Contamination cannot exist within 30 tiles
- +50 sector_value to all tiles within 20 tiles
- Catastrophes cannot damage tiles within 25 tiles

**Multiplayer Visibility:**
- All players see the monument from anywhere on the map
- Server announcement: "Overseer [X] has achieved Transcendence!"
- Permanent marker on all players' minimaps
- Creates pilgrimage destination for other overseers

### 4.5 Repeatability

**Can you build multiple Transcendence Monuments?**

**Yes.** Each monument represents a new transcendence achievement.

**Requirements for subsequent monuments:**
- Additional 500,000 arcology capacity beyond previous threshold
- Second monument requires 1,000,000 total arcology capacity
- Third requires 1,500,000, etc.

**Why Allow Repeats:**
1. Endless sandbox means endless achievement
2. Extreme late-game players need goals
3. Multiple monuments create visual legacy
4. No artificial cap on achievement

**Visual Variation:**
Each subsequent monument is visually distinct:
- First: White/gold light
- Second: Blue/silver light
- Third: Violet/aurora light
- Fourth+: Increasingly otherworldly

---

## 5. Edict System Design

### 5.1 What Are Edicts?

Edicts are **colony-wide passive bonuses** that represent the overseer's guiding philosophy. They are NOT ordinances (which cost credits) - edicts are free benefits unlocked by reaching the 10K milestone and building the Command Nexus.

**Key Differences from Ordinances (Epic 11):**

| Ordinances | Edicts |
|------------|--------|
| Ongoing credit cost | Free once unlocked |
| Can enable/disable anytime | Must choose, limited slots |
| Incremental effects | Significant effects |
| Available from start | Requires 10K + Command Nexus |

### 5.2 Edict Slots

**Slot Progression:**
- Command Nexus built: 1 edict slot
- 30K beings: 2 edict slots
- 60K beings: 3 edict slots
- 90K beings: 4 edict slots

**Edicts can be changed, but:**
- 10-cycle cooldown when switching
- Encourages commitment to playstyle
- Not meant for micro-optimization

### 5.3 Available Edicts

#### Growth Edicts

| Edict | Effect | Fantasy |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Welcoming Presence** | +15% migration rate | "We attract new beings" |
| **Fertile Ground** | +10% birth rate | "Our colony grows from within" |
| **Adaptive Sprawl** | -20% terrain clearing cost | "We expand efficiently" |

#### Economy Edicts

| Edict | Effect | Fantasy |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Trade Magnate** | +10% exchange tribute | "Commerce thrives here" |
| **Industrial Efficiency** | +10% fabrication output | "Our factories excel" |
| **Frugal Administration** | -10% service costs | "We do more with less" |

#### Harmony Edicts

| Edict | Effect | Fantasy |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Collective Spirit** | +10% harmony baseline | "We are content" |
| **Clean Living** | -15% contamination generation | "We protect our world" |
| **Peaceful Coexistence** | -15% disorder generation | "Harmony prevails" |

#### Infrastructure Edicts

| Edict | Effect | Fantasy |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Energy Abundance** | +10% energy production | "Power flows freely" |
| **Fluid Mastery** | +10% fluid extraction | "Water is plentiful" |
| **Efficient Pathways** | -15% flow_blockage | "Traffic flows smoothly" |

#### Defense Edicts

| Edict | Effect | Fantasy |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Vigilant Watch** | +20% service coverage radius | "We see all" |
| **Resilient Structures** | +15% catastrophe resistance | "We endure" |
| **Rapid Response** | +25% emergency response speed | "We react instantly" |

### 5.4 Edict Selection Experience

**When Command Nexus is built:**
1. Edict selection UI opens (modal, important moment)
2. Player browses available edicts with descriptions
3. Player selects first edict - feels significant
4. Confirmation: "This edict will shape your colony's character."

**When additional slots unlock:**
1. Notification: "New edict slot available!"
2. Player can add second edict without changing first
3. Existing edicts can be swapped (with cooldown)

**Visual Feedback:**
- Active edicts shown in Command Nexus holographic display
- Colony-wide subtle visual effects based on active edicts
- Other players can see your edict choices (via query tool)

---

## 6. Multiplayer Dynamics

### 6.1 Milestone Visibility Spectrum

**Design Principle:** Higher milestones = more public celebration

| Milestone | Your Experience | Others' Experience |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2K | Full celebration | Can see glow if looking |
| 10K | Full celebration + unlock | Toast notification to all |
| 30K | Full celebration + customization | Toast + map marker |
| 60K | Full celebration + variant choice | Toast + visual effect |
| 90K | Full celebration + server event | Beacon visible server-wide |
| 120K | Full celebration + philosophical moment | Server-wide aurora effect |

### 6.2 Friendly Competition Dynamics

**Natural Competition Points:**
- "First to 10K" race in new games
- "Most arcologies" informal leaderboard
- "Biggest colony" prestige
- "First to Transcendence" ultimate achievement

**How This Stays Healthy:**
1. No in-game leaderboards (no explicit ranking)
2. Players self-organize competition
3. Sandbox nature means "winning" is personal definition
4. Late joiners aren't locked out of achievement

### 6.3 Shared Stories

Milestones create memorable moments:
- "I hit 60K right when a vortex_storm hit"
- "We both hit 30K in the same cycle!"
- "I placed my monument where you could see it from your colony"
- "Your Resonance Spire is visible from my Command Nexus"

**Design Goal:** Progression creates stories players tell each other during and after play.

### 6.4 Arcology Comparison

**Can players compare arcology progress?**

Yes, through:
- Visual inspection (arcologies are visible)
- Query tool (shows arcology type and capacity)
- Optional statistics panel (total arcology capacity per player)

**This creates:**
- Friendly "arcology race" dynamics
- Inspiration from seeing others' achievements
- No explicit competition pressure

## 7. Questions for Systems Architect

### Milestone System Questions

1. **Milestone Notification Delivery:**
   - How are milestone notifications sent to all connected clients?
   - Is there a MilestoneEvent that triggers UI and audio on all clients?
   - What's the latency tolerance for synchronized celebrations?

2. **Population Counting for Milestones:**
   - Does arcology population count toward milestone thresholds?
   - Example: Player at 115K with arcologies housing 10K - are they at 125K for milestone purposes?
   - Proposed: Yes, all beings count regardless of structure type

3. **Milestone State Persistence:**
   - Are achieved milestones stored in DB per player?
   - If player's population drops below threshold, do they lose milestone? (Proposed: No, once achieved always achieved)

### Edict System Questions

4. **Edict Stacking with Multiple Command Nexuses:**
   - Can a player build multiple Command Nexuses?
   - Do edicts stack if same edict selected? (Proposed: No, one instance per edict)
   - Do edict slot counts stack? (Proposed: No, slots based on milestones not buildings)

5. **Edict Data Storage:**
   - EdictComponent on player entity? Or dedicated system storage?
   - How are edict effects applied to simulation systems?

6. **Edict Multiplayer Sync:**
   - How quickly do edict changes propagate to clients?
   - Can players see each other's edicts? (Proposed: Yes, via query tool on Command Nexus)

### Arcology System Questions

7. **Arcology Capacity Calculation:**
   - How is total arcology capacity tracked for Transcendence threshold?
   - Is this a running sum, or calculated on demand?
   - ArcologyCapacityComponent on player entity?

8. **Arcology Self-Containment:**
   - How do arcologies reduce infrastructure strain?
   - Internal energy/fluid generation, or reduced consumption?
   - Proposed: Reduced consumption (50% of normal per capita)

### Transcendence Monument Questions

9. **Monument Unlock Check:**
   - When is arcology capacity checked against threshold?
   - Is it continuous, or triggered by arcology construction?
   - Event-driven: "Check threshold on arcology construction complete"?

10. **Monument Effects Radius:**
    - How are area effects (harmony boost, contamination immunity) implemented?
    - TranscendenceAuraComponent with radius queries?
    - Performance implications of 50-tile radius effects?

## 9. Summary & Recommendations

### Key Design Principles

1. **Milestones Celebrate, Not Gate:** Every milestone is a moment of joy, never a requirement
2. **Reward Buildings = Prestige:** Utility is secondary to looking impressive
3. **Arcologies = Late-Game Ambition:** Massive investment for massive density
4. **Transcendence Replaces Exodus:** Achievement without ending
5. **Edicts = Colony Character:** Free bonuses that define playstyle
6. **Multiplayer-Aware:** Others see your progress, creating social dynamics

### Priority Features (MVP)

1. **Milestone System:** 6 thresholds with celebrations
2. **Reward Buildings:** All 5 types (Sanctum, Nexus, Marker, Complex, Spire)
3. **Arcology Unlock:** 4 types at 120K
4. **Edict System:** 15 edicts, slot progression

### Deferred Features (Post-MVP)

- Transcendence Monument (requires extensive arcology play)
- Additional arcology variants
- Edict combinations/synergies
- Milestone-based achievements/statistics tracking

### Experience Summary
