## Experience Goals

### What Should Managing Pathways Feel Like?

**Core Fantasy: The Connector**

Where energy powers your colony and fluid sustains it, pathways *unite* it. Managing the pathway network should feel like weaving the fabric that binds your settlement together. Without pathways, buildings exist in isolation -- with them, your colony becomes a living, breathing organism with circulation.

**Experiential Pillars:**

1. **Connection Creates Life**
   - Pathways enable buildings to function and develop
   - The 3-tile proximity rule creates clear cause-effect: "no pathway access = no development"
   - Watching your first pathway unlock building development should feel like opening a valve
   - "I connected it, now it can grow"

2. **Flow as Heartbeat**
   - Flow (traffic) represents the activity and vitality of your colony
   - Active pathways with beings and vehicles moving create a sense of life
   - Empty pathways feel like quiet neighborhoods; busy pathways feel vibrant
   - Flow is **cosmetic** but emotionally important -- it tells the story of your colony

3. **Network Topology as Puzzle**
   - Unlike energy/fluid (coverage zones), pathways create actual connected networks
   - Intersection placement, pathway routing, and network efficiency become strategic
   - The player becomes a network designer, not just an area coverer
   - "How do I connect A to B efficiently?"

4. **Shared Infrastructure (Unique to Pathways)**
   - Per canon: pathways connect across ownership boundaries
   - Your beings walk your neighbor's pathways and vice versa
   - This creates genuine **interdependence** unlike energy/fluid
   - "We share roads" -- a fundamentally different social dynamic

**Fundamental Difference from Energy and Fluid:**

| System | Model | Connection | Feel |
|--------|-------|------------|------|
| Energy | Pool + Coverage | Does NOT connect across ownership | Industrial, self-contained |
| Fluid | Pool + Coverage | Does NOT connect across ownership | Organic, self-sufficient |
| Pathways | Physical Network | DOES connect across ownership | Social, interconnected |

This difference is profound. Pathways are the first infrastructure where your colony's fate is physically tied to your neighbors'.

## Core Fantasy: The Network Builder

### The Joy of Connection

Building pathways should feel like **drawing the circulation system** of your colony. Each segment connects points, and the accumulation creates something greater than its parts -- a network.

**The Satisfying Moments:**

1. **First Pathway Placement**
   - The very first pathway segment should feel momentous
   - Watch as nearby zones suddenly gain "pathway access" status
   - Buildings that were stalled begin development
   - "I've given them a way to move"

2. **The Network Takes Shape**
   - As pathway segments connect, the network visualization emerges
   - Junction (intersection) creation feels like building nodes of activity
   - The minimap shows your pathway network like arteries on a map
   - Pride in the shape and structure of your network

3. **First Signs of Flow**
   - When beings and vehicles appear on your pathways (cosmetic entities)
   - The colony feels ALIVE for the first time
   - Not player-controlled, but player-caused
   - "Look at them go -- I built this"

4. **Connecting to Neighbors**
   - Per canon: pathways connect across ownership
   - The moment your pathway touches a neighbor's and flow appears
   - A genuinely social moment in an infrastructure system
   - "We're connected now"

5. **Solving Flow Blockage**
   - When a congested pathway is upgraded or bypassed
   - Watch flow redistribute across the improved network
   - Problem-solving satisfaction
   - "I fixed the bottleneck"

### What Players Should Say

- "My pathway network is efficient and beautiful"
- "Look at all the beings moving through my colony"
- "I need to fix that flow_blockage near the exchange district"
- "Our colonies are connected -- we share the same network"
- "I should have built more transit corridors earlier"

## Emotional Arc

### The Transportation Journey Through Game Lifecycle

#### Early Game: Simple Connections (Cycles 0-50)

**Context:**
The player has placed their first zones and infrastructure (energy, fluid). Now they need pathways to enable development. Buildings within 3 tiles of pathways can develop; those beyond cannot.

**Experience Goals:**
- First pathway placement is a clear tutorial moment
- Immediate feedback: buildings begin development
- Simple layouts work fine initially
- "I just need to connect things"

**Emotional Tone:** Discovery and enablement. "Pathways make things work."

**Key Moments:**
- First building develops after pathway placed nearby
- First cosmetic beings appear on pathways
- First junction created (intersection where pathways meet)
- Understanding the 3-tile rule through experience

---

#### Mid Game: Optimization and Growth (Cycles 50-200)

**Context:**
The colony is growing. Zone expansion requires pathway expansion. The player starts noticing flow_blockage (congestion) in high-traffic areas. Simple grids may not suffice.

**Experience Goals:**
- Flow_blockage becomes a real concern
- Pathway type upgrades matter (basic vs. standard vs. transit_corridor)
- Network topology decisions become strategic
- "How do I route flow efficiently?"

**Emotional Tone:** Strategic tension. "I need to think about my network design."

**Key Moments:**
- First significant flow_blockage slows district development
- First transit_corridor (highway) placement feels powerful
- First time player deliberately designs a pathway layout for efficiency
- Realizing that network shape affects colony performance

**New Challenges:**
- Flow_blockage reduces sector_value in congested areas
- High-density zones generate more flow
- Transit_corridors become desirable for major arteries
- Junction design matters (how many pathways meet?)

---

#### Late Game: Mastery and Rail (Cycles 200+)

**Context:**
The pathway network is established. The player has experienced flow_blockage and learned to manage it. Now rail systems become available as the "next level" of transportation.

**Experience Goals:**
- Rail_lines offer high-capacity alternative to congested pathways
- Subterra_rail provides underground solution for established colonies
- Rail_terminals become landmark structures
- Mastery over the complete transportation network

**Emotional Tone:** Pride and refinement. "I've built a sophisticated transit system."

**Key Moments:**
- First rail_line placement feels like a civilization upgrade
- First subterra_rail solves a problem that pathways couldn't
- Rail_terminals become focal points of activity
- Network optimization becomes a prestigious pursuit

**End-State Vision:**
- Efficient pathway network with minimal flow_blockage
- Transit_corridors handling major flow
- Rail_lines connecting distant regions
- Subterra_rail serving dense core areas
- A transportation network the player is proud of

---

- Landmark visibility (you can see transit_corridors from far away)

**Placement Satisfaction:**
- Transit_corridor placement should feel like "building something important"
- Sound effect: substantial placement sound
- Visual effect: construction animation, then activation glow

---

#### Rail Line

**Fantasy:** "The Express"

**Feel:**
- Completely different transport mode
- Visually: dedicated track with rails, glowing rail points
- Extremely high capacity, fixed routes
- Late-game infrastructure upgrade

**Player Experience:**
- Feels like a civilizational achievement
- "My colony is advanced enough for rail"
- Requires planning (fixed routes, terminal placement)
- Creates visual landmarks across the map

**Design Notes:**

- Underground routes not directly visible, but implied (minimap shows dashed lines?)
- Terminal glow: deep blue/purple (different from surface rail)
- Beings descending into terminals, emerging at others

---

## Flow (Traffic) Experience

### What Should Flow_Blockage Feel Like?

Flow represents the movement of beings and goods through your pathway network. Flow_blockage (congestion) is when pathways cannot handle the demand.

**Important Canon Note:** Flow is handled by **cosmetic entities** -- beings walking on pathways, vehicles on roads. These are automated, NOT player controlled. They represent colony activity visually.

#### The Experience of Healthy Flow

**Visual Feedback:**
- Cosmetic beings move smoothly along pathways
- Vehicles travel at good speed
- Pathways glow steadily (not pulsing/stressed)
- Activity level matches zone development

**Player Feeling:**
- "My network is working"
- "Look at all that activity"
- Satisfaction in watching flow

**Audio:**
- Ambient pathway sounds (footsteps, vehicles at appropriate volume)
- Sounds of a living colony

---

#### The Experience of Flow_Blockage

**How Flow_Blockage Should Feel:**
Different from energy (dark) or fluid (parched) shortages. Flow_blockage is about SLOWDOWN and FRUSTRATION, not failure.

**Visual Feedback:**
- Cosmetic entities bunch up, move slowly
- Pathway glow shifts to amber/yellow (stressed)
- Severe blockage: glow shifts to red, pulsing
- Visual congestion clusters visible from zoomed out

**Player Feeling:**
- "That pathway is jammed"
- Mild frustration (mirrors real traffic frustration)
- Motivation to fix the problem
- NOT game-ending, just annoying and limiting

**Audio:**
- Different ambient sound (slower, more crowded feel)
- Perhaps subtle "horn" sounds or stressed vehicle audio

---

#### Impact of Flow_Blockage

**What Happens When Pathways Are Congested:**

1. **Sector Value Penalty**
   - Congested pathways reduce sector_value for adjacent tiles
   - "No one wants to live on a traffic jam"
   - Visual: lower land value in overlay

2. **Development Slowdown**
   - Buildings in congested areas develop slower
   - Not blocked entirely, just delayed
   - Incentivizes fixing congestion

3. **Cosmetic Impact**
   - Beings in congested areas move slowly
   - Visual representation of dysfunction
   - Story-telling through animation

**What Flow_Blockage Should NOT Do:**
- NOT: Destroy buildings (unlike disasters)
- NOT: Kill beings (unlike fluid shortage)
- NOT: Create cascading failures (unlike energy)
- It's annoying and limiting, not catastrophic

---

#### Solving Flow_Blockage

**Player Solutions:**

1. **Upgrade Pathway Type**
   - Replace basic pathway with standard pathway
   - Replace standard pathway with transit_corridor
   - Immediate capacity increase

2. **Add Parallel Routes**
   - Build alternative pathways for flow to distribute
   - Network redundancy reduces bottlenecks
   - "Give them another way to get there"

3. **Redesign Junctions**
   - Complex junctions (many pathways meeting) cause blockage
   - Redesign to spread traffic across multiple junctions
   - Network topology optimization

4. **Build Rail Alternatives**
   - Rail_lines provide high-capacity alternatives
   - Diverts flow from congested pathways
   - Late-game solution

**Satisfaction of Fixing Flow_Blockage:**
- Watch congestion dissipate after fix
- Pathway glow returns to healthy cyan
- Cosmetic entities move smoothly again
- "I solved that problem"

---

## Visual Integration

### Bioluminescent Pathways

Pathways should integrate seamlessly with the bioluminescent art direction while being visually distinct from energy and fluid infrastructure.

#### The Pathway Color Palette

| System | Healthy Color | Stressed Color | Critical Color |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Energy Conduit | Cyan/Green | Amber | Red |
| Fluid Conduit | Blue/White | Teal | Gray-Blue |
| Pathway | Soft Cyan/Teal | Amber/Yellow | Red (pulsing) |
| Rail Line | Orange/Amber | Amber (bright) | Red |

**Pathway Visual Language:**

1. **Active Pathways with Flow**
   - Soft cyan/teal edge glow (lane markers, borders)
   - Center surface: slightly darker with texture
   - Glow intensity scales with flow (more activity = brighter)
   - Cosmetic entities (beings, vehicles) add life

2. **Pathway with Flow_Blockage**
   - Edge glow shifts to amber/yellow
   - Pulsing effect (stressed)
   - Cosmetic entities bunched, slow-moving
   - Visual "density" cluster

3. **Empty Pathway (Low Activity)**
   - Dim cyan glow
   - Minimal cosmetic entities
   - Quiet, dormant feel
   - Not unhealthy, just quiet

4. **Transit Corridor Visual Treatment**
   - Brighter, wider glow
   - Multiple lane markers visible
   - Higher-speed vehicle animations
   - Landmark visibility from distance

5. **Rail Line Visual Treatment**
   - Orange/amber rail glow (distinct from pathways)
   - Track structure visible
   - Rail_transport vehicles (trains) with internal glow
   - Rhythmic light pulses as trains pass

6. **Subterra Terminal Visual Treatment**
   - Deep blue/purple glow
   - Underground entrance visual (descending stairs, platform)
   - Beings animate entering/exiting
   - Implies network beneath surface

#### Junctions (Intersections)

**Visual Design:**
- Junction points where pathways meet
- Brighter glow at junction centers
- Possible special textures (roundabout pattern? crosswalk markings?)
- Flow direction indicators (subtle arrows?)

**Design Consideration:**
Junctions are where flow meets. They should visually indicate activity concentration.

---

## Multiplayer Dynamics

### Pathways Connect Across Ownership (Unique Infrastructure)

**The Big Difference:**
Per canon, pathways are the ONLY infrastructure that connects across overseer boundaries. Energy conduits and fluid conduits do NOT cross ownership. Pathways DO.

This creates fundamentally different multiplayer dynamics.

#### Your Beings Use Their Pathways

**Mechanic:**
- Flow is calculated across the entire connected pathway network
- A being from Player A's colony can travel through Player B's pathways
- Cosmetic entities don't "belong" to specific players
- The network is truly shared

**Player Experience:**
- "That's not my being, that's from Player B's colony"
- Shared infrastructure feel
- Network interdependence
- "Our colonies are connected"

#### Shared Flow_Blockage

**Mechanic:**
- Congestion on one player's pathways affects flow for all connected players
- If Player A's junction is jammed, it affects Player B's flow too
- Shared consequences of infrastructure neglect

**Player Experience:**
- "Your flow_blockage is affecting my colony!"
- Creates pressure for all players to maintain infrastructure
- Potential friction point -- but also collaboration opportunity
- "Let's fix that bottleneck together"

---

#### Competition for Prime Locations

**Strategic Dynamics:**
- Key junctions and pathway routes become valuable
- Chartering sectors that control pathway access = power position
- "Gateway" tiles that connect regions become strategically critical
- Early pathway placement establishes network topology

**Player Experience:**
- "I need to charter that sector before they do -- it's the only good route"
- Territorial competition around pathway access
- Strategic thinking about where pathways WILL be

---

#### Cooperation Through Shared Infrastructure

**Positive Dynamics:**
- Players can cooperatively build pathway networks
- Shared transit_corridors benefit everyone
- Network effects: more connections = more value
- "Let's build a transit_corridor between our colonies"

**Player Experience:**
- Genuine cooperation moment (unlike energy/fluid)
- Shared investment, shared benefit
- Social infrastructure building
- "We built this together"

---

#### Pathway Diplomacy

**Social Dynamics:**
- Players may negotiate about pathway placement
- "Can you extend your pathway to connect to mine?"
- "Your flow_blockage is hurting my sector_value"
- "Let's cooperate on a transit_corridor"

**Player Experience:**
- Social interaction through infrastructure
- Diplomacy that has gameplay consequences
- Relationship building (or conflict) through pathways

---

#### Griefing Considerations

**Potential Griefing Vectors:**
- Deliberately creating flow_blockage to hurt neighbors
- Refusing to maintain pathways that others depend on
- Chartering "gateway" sectors and not building pathways

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Flow_blockage affects the owner too (self-punishing)
- Alternative routes usually possible (redundancy)
- Social pressure in sandbox environment
- Possible: pathway "eminent domain" if abandoned?

**Design Principle:**
Pathway interconnection creates interesting social dynamics. Some friction is okay -- it creates stories. But griefing should be difficult and self-punishing.

---

## The 3-Tile Proximity Rule

### Buildings Need Pathway Access

**The Rule (from canon ITransportConnectable):**
- Buildings beyond 3 tiles from a pathway cannot develop
- This is a hard requirement, not a soft modifier
- Applies to all zone buildings (habitation, exchange, fabrication) and service buildings

#### Player Experience of the 3-Tile Rule

**Discovery Moment:**
- Player zones an area but buildings don't develop
- "Why isn't this building developing? It has energy and fluid..."
- Discovery: "It's too far from a pathway!"
- Clear lesson about pathway necessity

**Design Feedback:**

1. **Placement Preview**
   - When placing zones, show pathway access status
   - Green highlight: within 3 tiles of existing pathway
   - Yellow highlight: no current access, but pathway could reach
   - Red highlight: impossible to service with current network

2. **Building Status Indicator**
   - Stalled buildings show "No Pathway Access" indicator
   - Clear iconography (broken pathway symbol?)
   - Tooltip: "This structure requires pathway access to develop. Distance: X tiles."

3. **Overlay Mode**
   - Pathway coverage overlay shows 3-tile radius around all pathways
   - Clearly shows which tiles have pathway access
   - Planning tool for zone placement

#### Stalled State When Access Lost

**What Happens:**
- Building has pathway access, develops normally
- Player demolishes pathway (or pathway destroyed by disaster)
- Building loses pathway access
- Building enters "Stalled" state

**Stalled State Effects:**
- Building stops functioning
- No economic activity
- No population capacity (beings leave)
- Visual indicator (warning glow, stalled icon)
- NOT destroyed, just paused

**Recovery:**
- Player builds new pathway within 3 tiles
- Building exits stalled state
- Functions resume
- "Connection restored"

---

## Rail System Fantasy

### Later-Game Progression

Rail systems represent the "next level" of transportation infrastructure -- a significant upgrade from pathways.

#### Rail as Civilizational Upgrade

**When Rail Unlocks:**
- Mid-to-late game (after pathway network established)
- Requires colony development milestone? (Epic 14 integration)
- Represents advanced infrastructure capability

**Player Experience:**
- "I've unlocked rail -- my colony is advanced!"
- Major investment decision (very expensive)
- Planning challenge (fixed routes, terminal placement)
- Visual statement ("This is a developed colony")

#### Rail Supplements, Doesn't Replace Pathways

**Design Philosophy:**
- Pathways remain necessary for local access (3-tile rule still applies)
- Rail provides high-capacity connections between distant points
- Rail_terminals must be connected to pathway network
- "Rail is the backbone, pathways are the capillaries"

**Player Experience:**
- Rail doesn't obsolete pathways
- Both systems work together
- Rail for long-distance, pathways for local
- Complete transportation network requires both

#### Rail Line Experience

**Placement:**
- Major decision (expensive, permanent feel)
- Planning: "Where do I need high-capacity transit?"
- Visual: construction animation, track being laid
- Activation: first rail_transport appears

**Operation:**
- Rail_transport moves along rail_lines
- High capacity, reduces pathway load
- Connects distant rail_terminals
- Scheduled or demand-driven? (question for systems architect)

**Visual:**
- Elevated or surface track (visual variety)
- Orange/amber glow (distinct from pathway cyan)
- Rail_transport vehicles with glowing windows
- Rhythmic passing animations

#### Subterra Rail Experience

**The Underground Solution:**
- For established, dense colonies
- Surface congestion solved without surface footprint
- Maximum cost, maximum prestige

**Placement:**
- Subterra_terminal placement (surface structure)
- Underground route implied (not directly visible)
- Connects terminals through underground network
- "Building under my colony"

**Visual:**
- Subterra_terminals: glowing underground entrance structures
- Deep blue/purple glow (distinct from surface rail orange)
- Beings animate entering/exiting
- Minimap shows underground routes as dashed lines?

**Player Experience:**
- Ultimate transportation infrastructure
- Pride in sophisticated transit system
- Solves problems other systems can't
- "I've built a subway system!"

#### Rail Terminal as Landmark

**Design Philosophy:**
- Rail_terminals and subterra_terminals should be LANDMARKS
- Visually prominent structures
- Activity hubs with many cosmetic entities
- Pride in placement and design

**Visual:**
- Larger footprint than other buildings
- Bright distinctive glow
- High cosmetic entity activity
- Architecturally interesting (alien transit station design)

## Terminology Alignment

### Canonical Terms (from terminology.yaml)

**Always Use:**

| Human Concept | Canonical Term | Context |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Road | Pathway | All pathway references |
| Roads | Pathways | Plural |
| Highway | Transit_corridor | High-capacity pathway |
| Traffic | Flow | Movement metric |
| Congestion | Flow_blockage | Negative flow state |
| Intersection | Junction | Where pathways meet |
| Street | Pathway | Use pathway instead |
| Railroad | Rail_line | Rail track infrastructure |
| Train | Rail_transport | Rail vehicle |
| Train station | Rail_terminal | Rail access point |
| Subway | Subterra_rail | Underground rail |
| Subway station | Subterra_terminal | Underground access |

**UI Text Examples:**
- "Pathway access required" (not "road access")
- "Flow_blockage detected in exchange district" (not "traffic congestion")
- "Place a transit_corridor to handle heavy flow" (not "build a highway")
- "Rail_terminal constructed" (not "train station")
- "Beings walking on pathways" (not "people walking on roads")

---

## Design Recommendations

### Priority Recommendations

**P0 - Critical (Must Have for MVP):**

1. **Pathway Placement System** - Basic pathway placement with visual feedback
2. **3-Tile Proximity Rule** - Buildings require pathway access for development
3. **Pathway Network Connectivity** - Connected pathway segments form network
4. **Cross-Ownership Connection** - Pathways connect across player boundaries
5. **Basic Flow System** - Flow calculation to determine blockage
6. **Flow_Blockage Visual Feedback** - Show congested pathways
7. **Pathway Types** - Basic and Standard pathways at minimum

**P1 - Important (Should Have):**

1. **Transit Corridor** - High-capacity pathway type
2. **Cosmetic Entities** - Beings and vehicles on pathways
3. **Flow Overlay** - UI overlay showing flow/blockage
4. **Junction Visualization** - Clear junction appearance
5. **Stalled State** - Building stalled indicator when pathway access lost
6. **Pathway Decay/Maintenance** - Pathways require upkeep

**P2 - Enhancement (Later Phases):**

1. **Rail System** - Rail_lines and rail_terminals
2. **Subterra Rail** - Underground rail system
3. **Transport Pods** - Alternative transport (if implemented)
4. **Advanced Flow Visualization** - Animated flow direction
5. **Pathway Audio** - Ambient sounds for active pathways

### Specific Design Decisions

**Decision 1: Flow is Cosmetic + Sector_Value, Not Functional Blocking**

Unlike energy (building stops working) or fluid (beings leave), flow_blockage should:
- Reduce sector_value (economic penalty)
- Slow development (not stop it)
- Show visual congestion (cosmetic impact)
- NOT prevent building function entirely

**Rationale:** Flow_blockage is annoying, not catastrophic. This matches the feel of real traffic -- frustrating, but not game-ending.

**Decision 2: Pathways Have THREE Tiers (Not More)**

- Basic Pathway (early game, low capacity)
- Standard Pathway (mid game, good capacity)
- Transit Corridor (late game, high capacity)

Additional pathway types add complexity without meaningful gameplay. Three tiers create clear upgrade path.

**Decision 3: Rail is Late-Game Supplement, Not Replacement**

Rail should:
- Unlock after pathway network established
- Require significant investment
- Supplement pathways for long-distance
- NOT replace need for local pathways

**Rationale:** We don't want players to abandon pathway networks. Rail adds depth, not obsolescence.

**Decision 4: Cross-Ownership Flow Creates Shared Fate**

Per canon, pathways connect across ownership. This means:
- Flow_blockage affects all connected players
- Players are incentivized to cooperate on infrastructure
- Neglecting pathways hurts everyone
- Creates social dynamics unlike energy/fluid

**Design Principle:** Embrace the social dynamics. Shared infrastructure = shared responsibility.

**Decision 5: Cosmetic Entities Scale With Activity**

Per canon, cosmetic entities (beings walking, vehicles) scale with colony activity:
- Low activity = few entities
- High activity = many entities
- Flow_blockage = bunched, slow entities
- Pure visual feedback, no gameplay impact beyond flow calculation

### Experience Guidelines for Implementation

1. **First Pathway Should Feel Like Unlocking Development**
   - Clear before/after state
   - Buildings that were stalled begin developing
   - "I gave them access"

2. **Flow_Blockage Should Be Visible Before It's Critical**
   - Amber warning before red crisis
   - Player has time to respond
   - Not a sudden penalty

3. **Transit Corridors Should Feel Powerful**
   - Immediate flow improvement when placed
   - Visual statement of infrastructure investment
   - Worth the cost

4. **Cross-Ownership Connection Should Be a Social Moment**
   - Visual feedback when your pathway connects to neighbor's
   - "We're connected now"
   - Positive framing, not threatening

5. **Rail Should Feel Like Achievement**
   - Major milestone in colony development
   - Visually impressive
   - "My colony is advanced"

## Summary

Epic 7 introduces the transportation network -- the **connective tissue** of your colony. Unlike energy (power) and fluid (life), pathways create **physical networks** that define how your colony moves and grows.

**Key Differentiators from Energy/Fluid:**

1. **Physical network model** (not pool + coverage)
2. **Connects across ownership** (shared infrastructure)
3. **Flow as experience** (cosmetic entities show colony life)
4. **Penalty is slowdown** (not failure or death)
5. **Topology matters** (network design puzzle)

**Core Experience Goals:**

1. Connection creates life -- pathways enable development
2. Flow shows colony vitality -- active pathways = alive colony
3. Network building is satisfying -- watching your network grow
4. Shared fate with neighbors -- cross-ownership creates social dynamics
5. Rail is civilizational upgrade -- late-game prestige infrastructure

**The Feeling We Want:**

Building pathways should feel like drawing the circulation system of a living organism. Watching flow move through your network should feel like watching the heartbeat of your colony. The 3-tile rule creates clear cause-effect. Flow_blockage is frustrating but solvable. Rail is the mark of an advanced civilization. And the fact that pathways connect to your neighbors creates a social dimension unique to this infrastructure system.

The player should feel like a **network architect** -- someone who connects, optimizes, and enables the movement that makes a colony truly alive.
