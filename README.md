# Sims 3000

A city-building simulation game inspired by the classic Sim City series.

## About

Sims 3000 is a ground-up rebuild of the classic city-building genre. Players will manage and grow their own cities, balancing infrastructure, economics, and citizen needs.

## Technical Approach

This project is being developed as an **engine-less game**, built directly without relying on existing game engines. The architecture is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for potential migration to a custom engine in the future.

## Status

Currently in early development.
